The Rally Mobile SDK is a key component of the Rally Protocol that allows developers to retake control of the user experience by eliminating the reliance for end-users to complete complex blockchain operations through third party apps. By utilizing the SDK, developers gain access to the necessary tools that enable them to create familiar and native mobile UX while leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology.

# Example Usage

### accounts (EOAs)

```
import 'package:rly_network_flutter_sdk/account.dart';


//create an account
// By default this will configure the keys for secure cloud syncing
final account = await WalletManager.getInstance().createWallet();

//Want to configure whether keys are synced to the cloud, you can pass in storage options
final account = await WalletManager.getInstance().createWallet(
    storageOptions: KeyStorageConfig(saveToCloud: false, rejectOnCloudSaveFailure: false)
);

// get current user account address
final address = await WalletManager.getInstance().getAccountAddress();

// delete account

await WalletManager.getInstance().permanentlyDeleteAccount();

```

## transactions

```
import 'package:rly_network_flutter_sdk/network.dart';

//get mumbai config for rally protocol sdk

final mumbai = rlyMumbaiNetwork;

// add your API Key

mumbai.setApiKey(env.API_KEY);

// this is simple method for claiming 10 test ERC20 tokens for testing

await mumbai.claimRly();

// get balance of any ERC20 token

await mumbai.getBalance(tokenAddress);

// transfer any ERC20 token, to transfer gaslessly token contract must support permit() or executeMetaTransaction() (most ERC20s on polygon support this)

await mumbai.transfer(transferAddress, double.parse(1), MetaTxMethod.ExecuteMetaTransaction, {tokenAddress});



// relay arbitrary tx through our gasless relayer. see complete example at https://github.com/rally-dfs/flutter-example-app/tree/main/app/lib/services/nft.dart

...

final gsnTx = GsnTransactionDetails(
    from: accountAddress,
    data: tx.data,
    value: "0",
    to: contractAddress,
    gas: gas.toString(),
    maxFeePerGas: maxFeePerGas.toString(),
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: maxPriorityFeePerGas.toString(),
    );

await mumbai.relay(gsnTx)
